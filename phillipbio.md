###**Hello all, my name is Philip.**

##General Information:
I live in Renton, WA, about 20-30 minutes outside of Seattle. 
I enjoy hiking, eating, playing video games, cooking, and watching movies in my spare time.
I am in this program because I am interested in CS and the opportunities it opens in in the tech world.
As of yet I am undecided what fields I want to go into. CS has so many different aspects. I am on a 
mission to figure out what CS concentrations and career paths I want to take. Currently usability seems
very interesting!
I have experience building computers as a hobby for fun!!

##Programming Background:
In high school I never thought I'd choose to be a computer science major. I didn't understand enough
about computers to even think about a career in this field. In my first undergrad, I avoided CS
courses after taking a course freshman year on scientific programming (*Matlab*). It was very unpleasant
and it scared me away from programming. I took one Python course though, in my senior year of undergrad.
I figured learning some coding skills would be useful for a career. Little did I know I was going to
decide a year later to go back to school for an actual CS degree.

I spent a year unemployed hunting for jobs with a BS in Physics without success. I then did an internship
at a construction firm and I felt totally under-employed. I then decided it was time to go back to school
and find something I enjoyed that was also challenging and rewarding. I decided on the OSU Post-Bacc program
because it is convenient and awards a BS degree.

So far I have completed 1 quarter of the program. My favorite project in CS165 was the *tic-tac-toe* game
we created using arrays.
