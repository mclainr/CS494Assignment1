Hello, my name is Renee and I live in Hillsboro, Oregon. I am a licensed elementary school teacher, and I also teach driver education. 
I have many interests.   I love being outside. Hiking, camping, fishing, swimming, skiing... anything that has to do with outside is great. I also ride a motorcycle and enjoy back roads motorcycle rides.
I have two sons, Ryan and Jackson, that keep me busy when I'm not working or studying.  We love exploring the Portland area together.  The 4T is our favorite hike, so if you are ever in the area, look us up and we will take you to see a great view of the city!!

More Info:
One thing that I love to do is cook.  Trying new recipes is always a fun time, although my sons don't often appreciate the new creations!!

More Content:
One of my favorite classes that I have taken in this program was Usability Engineering.  My first undergraduate degree was in Psychology, and for me that class beautifully merged my two majors!

ReWriting the Future:
I am taking this program because I love computers and I think that managing computers is easier than managing 8 year olds (well, sometimes I think that).  I have my dream job picked out, it's just waiting for me to graduate.  I am going to be a Field Applications Engineer at Intel!!

##Programming Background
My programming experience is limited to what I did in 161 and 162.  

My favorite project was my final project in 161.  
I created a software program to help elementary school children in math.  I pulled from the Oregon Common Core Standards and developed a program that guides the child through 5 core areas with the assistance of "Fiona the Firefly" who gives recursive stars for correct answers and guidance for incorrect answers.  I was a lot of fun pulling together new coding tools into an environment that I felt comfortable in.
